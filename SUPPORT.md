# Support

This article explains where to get help with this project. If you suspect a bug (or wanted feature) with the library, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md].

The first step is see if available resources answer your auestion. See our documention (XXX) and BEA's general API documentation. You can also search our Issues (including those "closed") and our Discussion forums for related topics.

If none of that answers our question you can post a question in on our Discussions forum. It is very helfup to put in extra effort so that someone not familiary with your problem can understand your issue.

You may also provide feedback developers@bea.gov (feedback and code can be provided together as an .ipynb file, or can be provided separately, in the formats of your preference).
